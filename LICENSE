Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU Lesser General
Public License is intended to allow you to run, share, and modify
free software — to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages — typically libraries — of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.
You can use it too, but we suggest you read this license carefully.

1.0.0.0 — DEFINITIONS

1.1. “Library” means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

1.2. “Application” means any program that contains no part of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled
or linked with it, or by using it at runtime.

1.3. “Combined Work” means a work produced by combining or linking
an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
determines the license for the Combined Work.

1.4. “Linked Version” means the Combined Work executed with the
Library at runtime, including any modifications to the Library itself.
